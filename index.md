## About Me
[cite_start]I am a Machine Learning Engineer at **Infocusp Innovations** [cite: 22, 23] [cite_start]and a former Research Fellow at **IIT Madras**. [cite_start]My work focuses on **Reinforcement Learning**, specifically developing frameworks for molecular generation and autonomous driving policies[cite: 12, 18]. [cite_start]I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science from **IIT Bhilai**[cite: 6].
